Anchorboot
==========

Anchorboot is a new platform firmware distribution for ARM-based
ChromeOS devices using coreboot and U-Boot, with the aim to make it easy
to install and use conventional Linux distributions on them through UEFI
support.

It is still in initial, proof-of-concept phases of development, so be
sure to check back later!
