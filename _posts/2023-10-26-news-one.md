This is Anchorboot News #1, a semi-regular update post about the state
of the project. Not as much progress as I would've liked to get done, in
part because I was busy with [DebConf 23](https://debconf23.debconf.org)
for most of September. Then I had to do some urgent maintenance on my
workstation, and fell into a bout of low-energy. Anyway, here's the
interesting new bits related to the project:


Hardware
--------

In the last news post I mentioned that I'd been talking to Googlers
about getting proper debug hardware, and that package indeed arrived a
few days after then. So now I have a [Servo Micro](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/third_party/hdctools/+/main/docs/servo_micro.md)
for most of my boards that don't support closed-case debugging ("CCD"),
a [SuzyQable](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/third_party/hdctools/+/main/docs/ccd.md)
for those that support CCD, and a [Servo v4.1](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/third_party/hdctools/+/main/docs/servo_v4p1.md)
for even more complex testing and debugging over CCD or Servo Micro.

Out of the boards I have, the following are those which don't support
CCD, but use a Servo header for the Servo Micro to connect to:

- HP Chromebook 14 G3 ("blaze")
- Medion Chromebook S2015 ("mighty")
- Lenovo 300e Chromebook 2nd Gen MTK ("hana")
- Samsung Chromebook Plus ("kevin")

They didn't actually have the header, just had the pads to solder one
to. I had already bought [the headers](http://www3.panasonic.biz/ac/ae/search_num/index.jsp?c=detail&part_no=AXK750347G),
so I took them to an electronics repair shop and got them soldered on
the boards.

The Samsung Chromebook XE303C12 ("snow") and Samsung Chromebook 2 11"
XE503C12 ("pit") have different connectors. I don't have the proper
debug hardware for those, so will need to come up with a less capable
ad-hoc solution. The Acer Chromebook 314 CB314-2H ("cozmo") does have a
Servo header, but it already supports CCD so I saw no need to get one
soldered.


Debugging
---------

I started exploring how to work these Servo debug hardware. As a first
step I set up a ChromiumOS development chroot to be able to use the
corresponding software tools, and tried to work on my "kevin" board
since I actually have something other than the stock firmware that
somewhat works as firmware replacement.

Most importantly, I have been interested in accessing the serial console
since it's the best way of knowing what problems may come up in early
firmware stages, and writing the system firmware with less effort and
risk. I have managed to learn that much and other simple things like
powering on, resetting, and shutting down the board.

U-Boot
------

I worked a bit more on the video damage tracking and QEMU ramfb support
series to address the upstream reviews, but there are still things I
need to figure out before I can send what I have as new versions.
Especially about how partial display updates would interact with how EFI
wants to use the frame buffer, and how U-Boot would modify the
device-tree QEMU provides at runtime to make itself use ramfb drivers.

Other than those, I noticed the display stopped working on the "kevin"
board on v2023.10, and tracked it down to [reference counting support for
regulators](https://lore.kernel.org/u-boot/20230419134526.128800-1-eugen.hristev@collabora.com/).
Luckily, other people had already sent [fixes for enabling video-related
regulators](https://lore.kernel.org/u-boot/20231003062534.42325-1-clamor95@gmail.com/),
which were just recently merged upstream.


Coreboot
--------

I'm still working on adding display support for coreboot for ARM QEMU
virtual machines in a way that doesn't break x86 cases. Coreboot does
seems to do more stuff for x86 than U-Boot, like support for Cirrus
display device and VGA text mode. Those might not be applicable to ARM
systems and I think I'll try to split them out as x86-only parts while
keeping the Bochs display driver arch-independent.


Libreboot
---------

In case you haven't noticed: I also contribute to Libreboot, which
happens to include my initial proof-of-concept for this project, namely
using U-Boot as a coreboot payload on ARM systems. I have [updated their
U-Boot sources to v2023.10](https://libreboot.org/news/libreboot20231021.html#updated-u-boot-revision-2023.10),
rebased their patches, added fixes, improved board configurations.
