This is Anchorboot News #4, a semi-regular update post about the state
of the project. I haven't been able to work for a long time, but am
recovering well.


QEMU Display Drivers
--------------------

I have tried to clean up and submit relevant patches from my
[VGA Text Mode](https://anchorboot.org/posts/2024/04/21/vga-text-mode.html)
post. The [port I/O functions](https://review.coreboot.org/c/coreboot/+/80372)
that I needed to access PCI I/O space (to use `-device VGA` on non-x86
virtual machines) have been merged after some discussion.

After that, I built another test build of coreboot and U-Boot to check
if I can use these devices as a backend for the "corebootfb" device in
U-Boot. While experimenting I saw that U-Boot re-assigned the PCI memory
regions for the devices to a different address, which invalidates the
framebuffer addresses we get from coreboot.

So, I have decided to also write a driver for the QEMU ramfb device,
which does not rely on PCI but instead uses the QEMU-specific firmware
configuration device.


RAM Detection on QEMU
---------------------

Previously, I had managed to write an ad-hoc parser to get memory
information from the flat device-tree binary to help fix RAM detection
on QEMU boards. In the meantime, other people have written more
[FDT helper functions](https://review.coreboot.org/c/coreboot/+/81081)
in coreboot. I have refactored [my patch](https://review.coreboot.org/c/coreboot/+/80322)
to build on top of theirs, and it is merged now. A followup that uses it
on RISC-V QEMU VMs has been merged, but the ARM64 counterpart isn't.


U-Boot for QEMU ARM64
---------------------

So far I have been using a psuedo-coreboot build of U-Boot based on the
QEMU code, and running it on QEMU to test. Currently, I am working on
removing the QEMU-specific parts in it, and porting existing coreboot
code to work on it. It's not done yet, but I could get a few things
like the memory map and corebootfb working. Here's a teaser:
