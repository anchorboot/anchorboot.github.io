This is Anchorboot News #0, the first of semi-regular update posts about
the state of the project. It's technically an announcement post since
there hasn't been a formal one yet -- hence the number zero.

I've been supposed to be focusing on this project for about two months
now... Most of that time went to loosely-related work instead. Oh well.
Nevertheless, there is some progress on the project.


Website
-------

The [Anchorboot.org](http://anchorboot.org) website is up and running
now, hastily prepared and lazily hosted on GitHub Pages. You are
probably reading this post there now. It can and will be improved.


Logo
----

I have designed a logo. It's an anchor with a power button symbol
instead of the ring. Smooth lines, colored white to contrast with a
black screen during boot, placed over a steelblue disk with shadow to
give three dimensional effect. Replacing the background disk with a
hazard pattern gives a nice version for development builds.

<div style="display: flex; flex-flow: row wrap; justify-content: space-between; align-items: center; column-gap: 10%; margin: 0 0 20px 0;">
  <a href="/anchorboot.svg" style="flex: 1; margin: 1%;">

U-Boot
------

In general, I ended up working on improvements and fixes that would've
needed to be done for the project eventually anyway:

The default EFI variable buffer size was too small, which was being
exhausted as U-Boot was trying to run Debian's ARM64 secure-boot shim.
Increased the default size, and found and fixed another size calculation
bug along with it.

I have tried to improve support for RK3288-based Chromebooks in U-Boot
by enabling SPI ROM images, Winbond SPI flash support, and various
options that are enabled in some boards but not all of them. I've also
attempted a port to the "mighty" board I have, but still untested.

Inspired by another series extending Bochs emulated display support to
non-x86 U-Boot builds and enabling it for RISC-V QEMU virtual machines,
I have enabled the same support for ARM ones.

I have updated and extended an existing video damage tracking series
that make text consoles significantly faster, and a QEMU ramfb support
patch series which enables another way to have an emulated display to
test U-Boot with. These need further work before being merged upstream.


Coreboot
--------

I have tried to investigate why the "kevin" Chromebook wasn't properly
powering off with the coreboot and U-Boot combination. Disabling ARM
TrustedFirmware-A's coreboot integration in the coreboot build happens
to work around it, so I'm thinking it's an issue due to the lack of
integration between U-Boot and coreboot.

Inspired by the Bochs display support series for U-Boot, I managed to
get it working on coreboot builds for ARM QEMU virtual machines. But it
needs cleaning up before it can be sent upstream.


Coreboot with U-Boot
--------------------

I had already implemented a proof-of-concept of using U-Boot as a
coreboot payload for the "kevin" board, and I worked on reimplementing
that on QEMU. I managed to copy enough from the QEMU-support in U-Boot
to new coreboot-arm and coreboot-arm64 build targets that can be
launched from coreboot as payloads and happen to work on QEMU.

Still, this is with no integration between the two at all, and full of
QEMU-specific code and assumptions that needs to be undone to run on
actual coreboot-supporting hardware.


Hardware
--------

I have been buying Chromebooks to work on as part of this project:

- Samsung Chromebook XE303C12 ("snow")
- Samsung Chromebook 2 11" XE503C12 ("pit")
- HP Chromebook 14 G3 ("blaze")
- Medion Chromebook S2015 ("mighty")
- Lenovo 300e Chromebook 2nd Gen MTK ("hana")
- Acer Chromebook 314 CB314-2H ("cozmo")

Those are in addition to a Samsung Chromebook Plus ("kevin") that I've
been working on for years. That feels like a broad enough collection for
now.

I have also acquired some better hardware to flash SOIC8 chips, the
connectors for Servo debug headers on some of those devices, and had a
simpler version of a ChromeOS debug cable made.

Other than that, I've been talking to Googlers about getting proper
debug hardware from them, and it looks like that will arrive in just a
few days.
