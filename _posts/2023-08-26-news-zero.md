This is Anchorboot News #0, the first of semi-regular update posts about
the state of the project. It's technically an announcement post since
there hasn't been a formal one yet -- hence the number zero.

I've been supposed to be focusing on this project for about two months
now... Most of that time went to loosely-related work instead. Oh well.
Nevertheless, there is some progress on the project.


Website
-------

The [Anchorboot.org](http://anchorboot.org) website is up and running
now, hastily prepared and lazily hosted on GitHub Pages. You are
probably reading this post there now. It can and will be improved.


Logo
----

I have designed a logo. It's an anchor with a power button symbol
instead of the ring. Smooth lines, colored white to contrast with a
black screen during boot, placed over a steelblue disk with shadow to
give three dimensional effect. Replacing the background disk with a
hazard pattern gives a nice version for development builds.

<div style="display: flex; flex-flow: row wrap; justify-content: space-between; align-items: center; column-gap: 10%; margin: 0 0 20px 0;">
  <a href="/anchorboot.svg" style="flex: 1; margin: 1%;">

U-Boot
------

In general, I ended up working on improvements and fixes that would've
needed to be done for the project eventually anyway:

The default EFI variable buffer size was too small, which was being
exhausted as U-Boot was trying to run Debian's ARM64 secure-boot shim.
[Increased the default size](https://source.denx.de/u-boot/u-boot/-/commit/9fd3f881c6edb3daf42277a24c4d1b8932a6df50),
and found and [fixed another size calculation bug](https://source.denx.de/u-boot/u-boot/-/commit/d7fe913f23b1907ac6ccb1552151fbcaa89bcdb0) along with it.

I have tried to improve support for RK3288-based Chromebooks in U-Boot
by [enabling SPI ROM images](https://source.denx.de/u-boot/u-boot/-/commit/871c40dcbe13e4cae823944362b79ab2b3cf9f23),
[Winbond SPI flash support](https://source.denx.de/u-boot/u-boot/-/commit/e5b33200f8fcc79c8555dd0b852827912abc0b04),
and [various other options](https://lore.kernel.org/u-boot/20230707191641.2216851-1-alpernebiyasak@gmail.com/T/#u)
that are enabled in some boards but not all of them. I've also attempted
a port to the "mighty" board I have, but that is still untested.

Inspired by another series extending Bochs emulated display support to
non-x86 U-Boot builds and enabling it for RISC-V QEMU virtual machines,
I have enabled [Bochs emulated display support for ARM QEMU virtual
machines](https://lore.kernel.org/u-boot/20230814173944.288356-1-alpernebiyasak@gmail.com/)
to have an easier time testing video-related work on U-Boot with QEMU.

Furthermore, I have [updated and extended an existing video damage
tracking series](https://lore.kernel.org/u-boot/20230821135111.3558478-1-alpernebiyasak@gmail.com/)
that make text consoles significantly faster, and likewise [extended a
QEMU ramfb support series](https://lore.kernel.org/u-boot/20230822121026.1007105-1-alpernebiyasak@gmail.com/)
which enables another way to have an emulated display to test U-Boot
with. These need further work before being merged upstream.


Coreboot
--------

I have tried to investigate why the "kevin" Chromebook wasn't properly
powering off with the coreboot and U-Boot combination. Disabling ARM
TrustedFirmware-A's coreboot integration in the coreboot build happens
to work around it, so I'm thinking it's an issue due to the lack of
integration between U-Boot and coreboot.

Inspired by the Bochs display support series for U-Boot, I managed to
get it working on coreboot builds for ARM QEMU virtual machines. But it
needs cleaning up before it can be sent upstream.


Coreboot with U-Boot
--------------------

I had already implemented a proof-of-concept of using U-Boot as a
coreboot payload for the "kevin" board, and I worked on reimplementing
that on QEMU. I managed to copy enough from the QEMU-support in U-Boot
to new coreboot-arm and coreboot-arm64 build targets that can be
launched from coreboot as payloads and happen to work on QEMU.

<video controls loop style="width: 100%; margin: 0 0 20px 0;">
  <source src="/assets/news-zero/qemu-boot.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

Still, this is with no integration between the two at all, and full of
QEMU-specific code and assumptions that needs to be undone to run on
actual coreboot-supporting hardware.


Hardware
--------

I have been buying Chromebooks to work on as part of this project:

- Samsung Chromebook XE303C12 ("snow")
- Samsung Chromebook 2 11" XE503C12 ("pit")
- HP Chromebook 14 G3 ("blaze")
- Medion Chromebook S2015 ("mighty")
- Lenovo 300e Chromebook 2nd Gen MTK ("hana")
- Acer Chromebook 314 CB314-2H ("cozmo")

Those are in addition to a Samsung Chromebook Plus ("kevin") that I've
been working on for years. That feels like a broad enough collection for
now.

I have also acquired some better hardware to flash SOIC8 chips, the
connectors for Servo debug headers on some of those devices, and had a
simpler version of a ChromeOS debug cable made.

Other than that, I've been talking to Googlers about getting proper
debug hardware from them, and it looks like that will arrive in just a
few days.
